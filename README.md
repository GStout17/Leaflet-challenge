# Leaflet-challenge

- Data collection comes from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), which is imported and visulized for the created map below!
- The created map uses Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
- Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
- Map includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- You can see the created work at this [link!](https://gstout17.github.io/Leaflet-challenge/)
